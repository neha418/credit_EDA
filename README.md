# Bank Loan Dataset Analysis
## Overview
This case study aims to apply EDA in a real business scenario. It aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their instalments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

## Business Objectives
* Identify Risk Patterns: Use exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns indicating clients who may have difficulty paying their loan installments.
* Mitigate Loan Default Risk: Utilize insights from EDA to take appropriate actions, such as denying loans, reducing loan amounts, or offering loans at higher interest rates to risky applicants. This aims to minimize the risk of loan default and ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected.
* Understand Driving Factors of Loan Default: Gain an understanding of the key variables or factors that strongly indicate loan default. This knowledge will help the company in portfolio management and risk assessment.
* Enhance Risk Analytics Knowledge: Independently research risk analytics to understand the types of variables and their significance in predicting loan default. This will deepen understanding of the domain and enable more informed analysis and decision-making.

## Tools
